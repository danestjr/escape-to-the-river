Summary
==================
This was a project that was completed as part of the Udacity Frontend Dev Nanodegree.
The goal was to create a game using object-oriented javascript. The user needs to 
cross the path of the evil bugs to reach the water. Once the user has reached the
water, the game restarts. If the user is not able to reach the water and is stopped by 
the evil bugs, the game restarts.

Languages
==================
Javascript

Running the Game
===============================
1. To play the game, you would need to first click on index.html.
2. To win the game, you would need to navigate yourself across the path to the water without hitting the bugs.
3. If you hit the bugs, your character will start from the beginning.
